## For Development

### Overview

To create a new target for installation, 
run `tools/create_target <name>` to create a target folder. 
Put your setting files in the folder and modify the Makefile if needed.

The framework requires that any target deploys necessay files under `_root` after running `make` or `make all`, 
as well as guarantees existence of `<target>/backup.list` for reverting. 
`backup.list` can be either a static file or generated by `make backup.list`.

The default `make install` puts all files under `_root` to `/`, 
and backup those files in `backup.list` **AND** those existing in `_root` to `_bkp`. 
On the other hand, the default `make revert` removes all files addressed in `_root`, 
and puts files in `_bkp` back to their original location.
